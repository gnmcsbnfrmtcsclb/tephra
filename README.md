### What is Tephra?

Tephra is a command line application to annotate [transposable elements](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposable_element) from a genome assembly. The goal is to provide a high quality set of de novo annotations for all transposon types, describe the structure and evolution of those sequences, and do it without a reference set of transposon sequences (therefore being unbiased as possible).

**DEPENDENCIES**

Part of the utility of Tephra is to provide family-level TE classifications and infer patterns of molecular evoltion. To be efficient as possible, these tasks require a few external programs. Specifically, you will need to download [MUSCLE](http://http://drive5.com/muscle/) and add this program to your system PATH. This program is free, but it has a special license so I cannot distribute it. If you are only interested in TE identification and classification, you can skip the installation of this program (it is only used for calculating the insertion age of transposons).

**INSTALLATION**

The following commands will install the core dependencies for Debian-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu):

    sudo apt-get install -y -qq build-essential zlib1g-dev unzip
    sudo apt-get install -y -qq libncurses5 libncurses5-dev libdb-dev git cpanminus libexpat1 libexpat1-dev

For RHEL-based systems (e.g., CentOS/Fedora):

    sudo yum groupinstall -y "Development Tools"
    sudo yum install -y perl-App-cpanminus ncurses ncurses-devel libdb-devel expat expat-devel zlib-devel java-1.7.0-openjdk

The next two commands install BioPerl, and these can be skipped if BioPerl is installed:
    
    cpanm Data::Stag DB_File
    echo "n" | cpanm -n Bio::Root::Version

Finally, download the [latest release](https://github.com/sestaton/tephra/releases/latest) and run the following commands from the root directory:

    cpanm --installdeps .
    perl Makefile.PL
    make test
    make install

Please note, the above instructions will install Tephra for a single user. If you would like to configure Tephra to be installed for all users on a cluster, you will need to set the TEPHRA_DIR environment variable. For example,

    export TEPHRA_DIR=/usr/local/tephra
    perl Makefile.PL
    make test
    make install

will configure the software for all users. Please note that if Tephra is configured in a custom location this way it will be necessary to set this variable prior to using Tephra so the configuration can be found. In this case, just export the variable the same way. For a regular user, this can be done with a single line as below (note that this is the same command used to install/configure Tephra):

    export TEPHRA_DIR=/usr/local/tephra

Now you can type any command to use the usage, for example:

    tephra findltrs -h

For developers, please run the tests with:

    export TEPHRA_ENV='development' && make test

Please report any test failures or installation issues with the [issue tracker](https://github.com/sestaton/tephra/issues).

**SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION**

You can get usage information at the command line with the following command:

    perldoc tephra

The `tephra` program will also print a diagnostic help message when executed with no arguments, and display the available subcommands.

You can also look for information at:

    Tephra wiki
            https://github.com/sestaton/tephra/wiki

    Tephra issue tracker
            https://github.com/sestaton/tephra/issues

**USAGE**

Tephra is a command-line program only for now. The command `tephra` itself controls all the action of the subcommands, which perform specific tasks. Typing the command `tephra` will show the available commands. Here is an example,

    $ tephra <command> [-?h] [long options...]
        -? -h --help  show help

    Available commands:
    
           commands: list the application's commands
               help: display a command's help screen
    
                all: Run all subcommands and generate annotations for all transposon types.
       classifyltrs: Classify LTR retrotransposons into superfamilies and families.
       classifytirs: Classify TIR transposons into superfamilies.
      findfragments: Search a masked genome with a repeat database to find fragmented elements.
      findhelitrons: Find Helitons in a genome assembly.
           findltrs: Find LTR retrotransposons in a genome assembly.
        findnonltrs: Find non-LTR retrotransposons in a genome assembly.
           findtirs: Find TIR transposons in a genome assembly.
          findtrims: Find TRIM retrotransposons in a genome assembly.
          illrecomb: Characterize the distribution of illegitimate recombination in a genome.
             ltrage: Calculate the age distribution of LTR retrotransposons.
            maskref: Mask a reference genome with transposons.
         reannotate: Transfer annotations from a reference set of repeats to Tephra annotations.
            sololtr: Find solo-LTRs in a genome assembly.
             tirage: Calculate the age distribution of TIR transposons.
            version: display an app's version


Typing a subcommand will show the usage of that command, for example:

    $ tephra findnonltrs
    ERROR: Required arguments not given.
    
    USAGE: tephra findnonltrs [-h] [-m]
        -m --man      :   Get the manual entry for a command.
        -h --help     :   Print the command usage.
    
    Required:
        -g|genome     :   The genome sequences in FASTA format to search for non-LTR-RTs. 

    Options:
        -o|outdir     :   The location to place the results.
        -p|pdir       :   Location of the HMM models (Default: configured automatically).


**CITATION**

A manuscript is in preparation, which includes a description of the all the methods and their uses, a comparison to other programs, and results from model systems. These will be provided in some form ahead of publication, as soon as they are available.

For now, please cite the github URL of this repo if you use Tephra. Thank you.
